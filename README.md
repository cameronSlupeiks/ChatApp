# chatApp üë®‚Äçüíª
A small program I built to experiment with Socket Programming in C using TCP/IP protocols. Users can chat back and forth via two seperate terminals on the same local network until a user enters "quit", in which case the program terminates.

## Getting Started

## Download Instructions
1) Download ZIP
2) Navigate to the diretory where you saved the project
3) Extract the project

## Running the App
1) In both terminals, navigate to the app directory.
2) To compile, enter the following command in one of the terminals:
```
make
```
3) Enter the following command in the first terminal:
```
./chat
```
4) Enter the following command in the second terminal:
```
./chat 127.0.0.1
```
5) Both terminals are now connected. You can now chat freely! 
6) To quit the program enter the following:
